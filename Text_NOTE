## Functions :
----------------
In the 8086 microprocessor, functions such as FUNC1, FUNC2, etc., refer to interrupt service routines that are invoked by software interrupts. The 8086 microprocessor supports interrupts (both hardware and software), which allow it to handle specific tasks like I/O processing, timer handling, and others.
## Overview of Functions and Interrupts in 8086: ##
The 8086 microprocessor uses the concept of interrupts to stop its main program flow temporarily and execute a service routine, known as an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR). Each interrupt has a vector that points to the starting address of the ISR. These interrupts can be invoked by interrupt instructions, such as INT n, where n is the interrupt number.

Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of the core types of interrupts:

Hardware Interrupts:

Generated by external devices.
For example, when you press a key on the keyboard, a hardware interrupt is generated, and the CPU switches to the ISR for that device.
Software Interrupts:

Generated by the INT n instruction in the program.
Used for various system services, such as displaying text, reading from a file, etc.
Predefined Interrupts:

The 8086 supports a predefined set of interrupts, numbered from 0 to 255. Each interrupt has a specific function. For instance:
INT 0: Divide by Zero error (Division Error).
INT 1: Single step for debugging.
INT 10h: Video services (displaying characters, clearing the screen, etc.).
Common Software Interrupts and Their Functions
INT 21h (DOS Interrupt)

One of the most widely used interrupts in DOS programs, providing various system services like file management, input/output, and program termination.
Functions within INT 21h include:

AH = 01h: Read a character from standard input.
AH = 09h: Display a string on standard output.
AH = 4Ch: Terminate a program.
INT 10h (BIOS Video Services)

Provides services for handling display (video) functionalities.
Common services under INT 10h include:

AH = 00h: Set video mode.
AH = 02h: Set cursor position.
AH = 09h: Write character and attribute at cursor position.
INT 13h (BIOS Disk Services)

Used for disk-related operations, like reading/writing sectors from a disk drive.
Key services include:

AH = 02h: Read disk sectors.
AH = 03h: Write disk sectors.
INT 16h (BIOS Keyboard Services)

Handles keyboard input operations.
Functions include:

AH = 00h: Read a keystroke from the keyboard buffer.
AH = 01h: Check if a key is pressed and return its value.
INT 17h (BIOS Printer Services)

Manages operations related to the printer.
INT 1Ah (BIOS Time/Date Services)

Used to read and set system time and date.
INT 20h (Program Termination)

Terminates the program and returns control to DOS.
