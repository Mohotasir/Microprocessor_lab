## 8086 microProcessor
- 16 bit microprocessor
## Registers(16bit) - AX , BX , CX , DX
- AX, BX, CX, and DX are general-purpose registers used to store data temporarily during program execution. Each of these registers is 16 bits wide and can be divided into two 8-bit registers, allowing both byte-level and word-level operations.
# 1. AX (Accumulator Register):
Purpose: Primarily used in arithmetic operations and I/O operations.
Divided into:
AH: The higher 8 bits of the AX register.
AL: The lower 8 bits of the AX register.
Common Usage: The AX register is often used to store the result of arithmetic operations like ADD, SUB, MUL, and DIV. It is also used for certain system calls and I/O operations.
